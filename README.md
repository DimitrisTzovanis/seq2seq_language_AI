# Sequence to Sequence Language AI + Tokenizer

## Members: Dimitris Tzovanis

#### Seq2Seq model, that responds to written prompts + Tokenizer

This form of artificial intelligence takes a sequence as input and produces a sequence as ouput. This can be used for translating between 2 languages or creating a chatbot, 
that learns how to answer on certain sequences.


To achieve this a tokenizer needs to be created first.

This is needed because we may train the seq2seq model on data from a variety of languages, and every character needs to be identified by the model.

To create the AI, first execute the tokenizer script (after of course editing the path to your desired csv file). Afterwards, you can run the seq2seq script

#### To generate response, write the prompt on the use_seq2seq script, betwwen the brackets, after the input variable, and then run the script.
